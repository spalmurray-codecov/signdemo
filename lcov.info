[Code Coverage/test]   | To get started you may need to restart your current shell.
[Code Coverage/test]   | This would reload your PATH environment variable to include
[Code Coverage/test]   | Cargo's bin directory ($HOME/.cargo/bin).
[Code Coverage/test]   | 
[Code Coverage/test]   | To configure your current shell, you need to source
[Code Coverage/test]   | the corresponding env file under $HOME/.cargo.
[Code Coverage/test]   | 
[Code Coverage/test]   | This is usually done by running one of the following (note the leading DOT):
[Code Coverage/test]   | . "$HOME/.cargo/env"            # For sh/bash/zsh/ash/dash/pdksh
